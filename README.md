# Investigation-of-Phenomena-Surrounding-an-Overworked-Lifestyle
A statistical analysis involving a cross-sectional survey and various qualtitative and quantitative techniques to determine factors leading to an overworked lifestyle.


Project Abstract: 

Overproductivity is an epidemic among Americans. Today, our lives are faster, busier, and more stressful than ever before. Previous researchers have found links between three phenomena (addictive social media usage (SMA), toxic productivity within a workplace (TP), and Imposter Syndrome (IS)) and perceived work overload (PWO), a predictor of an unbalanced work-rest relationship. This finding from pre-existing research sparked the goal of this research study: to find the “perfect storm” that connects each of the three aforementioned phenomena to both each other and PWO among respondents within the greater Chicagoland area. 

To assess the prevalence of each phenomena within 51 respondents of a cross-sectional survey, four Likert scales were used to determine the factors that influence each respondent, with the purpose of finding a variety of contributors to PWO. Both categorical and quantitative analyses were conducted on the responses. It was concluded that SMA has little to no effect on PWO within respondents, while a combination of both moderate TP and moderately high IS was the most prevalent indicator of high PWO. Additionally, only five of the fifteen tested factors were significantly influential in relation to PWO. These findings will allow for future research to further investigate the extent to which these factors influence PWO, and how we can combat PWO.

Both the final report (including all original Linkert scales and questions, as well as the final survey created) and the final presentation are uploaded.
